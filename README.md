# CIF file ingester

## Ingester description
The [CIF file ingester]("https://help.citrination.com/knowledgebase/articles/1200448-citrine-crystallographic-information-file-cif") converts standardized crystallographic information files (.cif) as popularized by the International Union of Crystallography (IUoC).
The CIF File Ingester currently extracts and featurizes a subset of structural properties to automatically featurize.
If there are properties contained in your .cif that you would like featurized upon ingestion, please reach out to us.

## Description of accepted files
.cif files output from DFT calculations, XRD refinements, or any other structure calculations.
